# Employee Tracker
 Bootcamp homework assignment #12 -- A command-line employee record management system that allows the user to view data from an employee database and make updates to that database.
 
# Installation and Useage
 Clone repository into VS Code session. Requires mySQL to import the database schema. Run npm i to install required node modules. To begin application, run "node index.js" to 
 begin prompts. After each prompt, you will need to run "node index.js" again in order to run the application again.  You may need to hit "cmd/ctrl + c" to reset the terminal after
 each command is finished. This is an issue I was not able to solve in time.
